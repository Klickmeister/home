    Du hast' ne geile Idee. Nicht nur mal eben im Kreativrausch - Nein, eine Idee mit Potential. Du hast sie nicht für Dich behalten, mit anderen geteilt, tiefer durchdacht, ausarbeiten lassen und gemerkt: **Das ist nicht nur eine geile Idee, sondern eine richtig gute!**<br>
    Du hast ein (Produkt)design. Es liegt vor Dir: hübsch ausgearbeitet, grafisch zweidimensional und papiergeduldig. Du kannst jetzt ne Menge Kohle versenken und Dein Team mit der Realisierung beauftragen. Oder wir bauen Dir erstmal einen Prototypen.

We already touched on this, but it bears further discussion. On paper or a computer screen, a design’s problems aren’t always noticeable. By creating a prototype, you can actually hold a version of your proposed product and determine what aspects do its job and which ones need refining. This is your chance to gather more accurate requirements and obtain market feedback.

1. Adjust the design. We already touched on this, but it bears further discussion. On paper or a computer screen, a design’s problems aren’t always noticeable. By creating a prototype, you can actually hold a version of your proposed product and determine what aspects do its job and which ones need refining. This is your chance to gather more accurate requirements and obtain market feedback.

2. Adjust colours, textures and shapes. Now that you can see your product, what would you change to make it more marketable?

3. Provides quality assurance. By testing the prototype, you can find any issues that produces flaws in your product. You can develop quality assurance testing methods and standards before you roll out full production.

4. Measure acceptable tolerance levels. This is your chance to decide if any design adjustments can make the production process more economical.

5. Know the true cost of production. Prototypes help engineers gain insight into the amount of material needed, which helps them to accurately quantify the true cost-per-unit of mass producing their product.

6. Improve the product’s integrity. A prototype lets you test for any structural weaknesses in your product that could affect functionality. You can fix the problem right away and control your costs. It also highlights any design unknowns and avoids downstream discovery

7. Find efficiencies and savings. At this stage, you can take a close look at your processes and see if you can consolidate any production steps to cut down on labour, equipment and raw material costs.

8. Modify your tooling. Once you’ve done your prototype, you may realise that you can make efficiencies by adjusting your tooling and equipment.

9. Make a more durable product. You’re in a position to judge whether you’re using the right fasteners and other components to produce a durable product.

10. Resolve conflicts. If your engineers are in disagreement about the product’s design, prototyping allows them to see which features work best and why. The result optimises the design, giving you the best possible product.

A variety of industries including automotive, construction and electronics regularly manufacture prototypes before beginning to full production. These initial prototypes are often rejected as impractical, difficult to produce, and unmarketable. Mostly, however, prototypes tend to offer new ideas and inspire excitement for moving on to the production stage.

Prototyping your future product helps to identify and formulate the main trajectory of the design and save time.

A prototype is an early sample or mock-up of the product we wish to build. It’s a quick model explaining the actual plans for the final product. It could be something as simple as hand-drawn sketches, integrated (lo-fi prototype) to demonstrate the product into a fully functional product(hi-fi prototype), which the stakeholders and users can feel and use.


Following are the fundamental reasons for using prototyping before creating a layout:
The prototype gives the customer a complete idea of ​​how the site will look like in the final result.
Prototyping allows you to streamline the design development process, focusing on important interface elements.
A site’s sketch is an irreplaceable thing if the client still does not fully understand what he expects from the site, what functions each page will carry. Careful planning at the prototyping stage makes it possible to avoid global changes in the finished layout.
At the prototyping stage, it is possible to identify unnecessary elements that are best abandoned.
This process significantly reduces the workload of the designer in developing the project, and thus saves the customer’s money.
Having a prototype in hand, the designer and customer more clearly represent the final result.
Prototype development involves the involvement of the customer, contributes to more productive work, process consistency.
In this case, the prototype is created very simply. Some species can be outlined already at the first meeting with the client, specifying certain details of the design.
Why make a Prototype?
Creating a prototype is one of the steps that precede the launch of the final product. In fact, prototyping your future product or service has several advantages:
