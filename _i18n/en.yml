      h1: The Web is diverse
      h2: and the possibilities are seemingly endless. We have conceptualized, built, used, discarded, revised, and retired many things. Currently, we are particularly interested in the following topics.

    information-engineering:
      title: Information Engineering
      linktext: More about Information Engineering
      intro: |
        "Data, data, data, and always think about the user." How do you turn your data into information? What data do I have, and how do I structure it best? How do I connect my data sources? How do I provide my data? We help and advise you on the conception and development of data visualizations and modeling or data provision.

    dev-ops:
      title: DevOps
      linktext: More about DevOps
      intro: |
        "Where is the whole thing supposed to go? And how do we get it there? A virtual host, our own server or Kubernetes?" These are questions that every project has to ask itself. We help you find a solution and implement it directly. No matter whether you want to launch a single site or host a complex system in the cloud.

    karten-und-visualisierungen:
      title: Interactive Maps
      linktext: More about Maps and Visualizations
      intro: |
        "Where can you find what? What's going on? Which way to go?"<br>You can put your answers into boring texts, dull lists, or nerdy tables, yawn... or you can send your data as visual candy at high speed into the cortex of your users.<br><br>
        **TLDR;** Interactive maps are super practical to make your data visible. We'll help you with that.

    prototypen:
      title: Prototyping
      linktext: More about Prototyping
      intro: |
        "You've got a great idea?" Not just in a creative frenzy - no, an idea with **tremendous** potential. You didn't keep it to yourself, shared it with others, thought about it deeply, had it elaborated, and realized: **This is not just a great idea, but a really good one!**<br>
        "You have a (product) design?" It's right in front of you: beautifully elaborated, graphically two-dimensional, and patiently waiting on paper.<br>Now, you can sink a lot of money and commission someone to implement it. Or, we can build you a prototype.<br>
        **TLDR;** Prototypes are budget-protecting life hacks.
    
    webaccessibility:
      title: Web Accessibility
      linktext: More about Web Accessibility
      intro: |
        "People with limitations are not my target audience" … may be true, but they are certainly part of your audience. With accessible websites, it's about more than just using the website with a screen reader. Accessible web content enables participation for everyone. It's [simple for everyone](https://einfach-fuer-alle.de/vorteile-barrierefreie-website/), whether or not they have limitations in vision, hearing, or motor skills: High color contrast also helps when surfing the web in the sun, as the content remains readable; keyboard operability helps when the Magic Mouse battery is low, you've broken your arm, or you're simply a power user. And let's not forget: accessible websites also help search engines because the content is more accessible. Hooray!
