Moved to Cologne 10 years ago and hasn't left since. After a long odyssey in nursing, she completely changed course and is now studying media informatics at TH KÃ¶ln. Outside of office and university hours, you'll often find her outdoors with friends, but she also doesn't say no to a good gaming session. She develops and maintains content for us and takes care of patients in the hospital. Quite a unique combination!
