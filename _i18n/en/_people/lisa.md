Code and Care Enthusiast

Moved to Cologne 10 years ago and hasn't left since. After a long journey in the healthcare sector, I made a complete career switch and am now studying Media Informatics at TH Cologne. Outside of office and university hours, you can usually find me hanging out with friends or enjoying a good gaming session. At our company, I develop innovative solutions, manage content, and take care of patients in the hospital. Quite the unique combination!
