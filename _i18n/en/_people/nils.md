Mountaineer

After a (short) excursion into mechanical engineering, Nils shifted towards computers and technology, enrolling in the Media Informatics program at TH KÃ¶ln. In addition to his role as a developer at Klickmeister, he can often be found in the bouldering hall or, in winter, skiing in the mountains.
