xIt feels like we just raised a glass to the new year yesterday. Now, we're well into it. Here's a quick recap: annual planning, a bit more organization at Klickmeister, client projects, the economy doesn't look so good...ouch, everyone's a bit scared, Jorge is leaving (sniff), Lisa is coming (hooray!)... surrounded by AI.

At ERCO, we further optimized the [Invia Configurator](https://www.erco.com/de/produkte/invia-48v-konfigurator-7678/), making significant improvements under the hood: refactored JavaScript, integrated [HELM Charts](https://helm.sh), introduced a new CSS concept, implemented a bunch of SEO optimizations, and much more.

With the Deutsche Bahn, we implemented new features for Vista, built a new tool for [routing replacement services](https://zugportal.de/ersatzverkehr), and removed [Max Maulwurf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Maulwurf) from onboard communication. ðŸ˜± RIP Max.

Bildmeister 2.0 is sooo close and almost ready. But somehow not quite there yet. The last miles are always the hardest. But it will definitely launch in 2023, retiring the old version.
