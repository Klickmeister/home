We appreciate our freedom of space. Unfortunately, we can't always choose everything (tasks, assignments, working hours, collaboration partners, etc.). Nevertheless, we have quite extensive freedom. The most significant freedom is undoubtedly the temporal and spatial flexibility. Since 2010, Klickmeister has embraced virtualization strongly, and with the C-19 pandemic, our clients have become significantly more location-independent. We aim to preserve and leverage this flexibility. Working from home, working from the office, working from a vacation home. Everything is possible.
