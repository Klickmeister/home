Every meeting needs a goal. Everyone should know what their goal is before a meeting. If you don't know, you might not be relevant to the meeting. The best thing about meetings is that you can make a little small talk and get to know people better. Use that opportunity! So don't just come in, say "Hello," open your laptop, and check emails; instead, come in, say "Hello," and chat a bit. It always helps!

We make sure not to attend too many meetings, and the frequency of meetings dictates at most half of our working days. No software project has ever been completed by having too many meetings.

For important meetings, we coordinate with key individuals beforehand to avoid surprises during the meeting itself. It's often very helpful to discuss a problematic or important topic with the "biggest opponent/doubter/opposer" beforehand.
