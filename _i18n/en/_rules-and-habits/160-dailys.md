The joke about Dailys: they happen every day. Who would have thought? They should be as short as possible. We make sure to be brief and only discuss things that involve multiple participants. Anything else is clarified outside of Dailys. We point out if a Daily takes too long or if topics are discussed that don't belong in the Daily. Anything lasting longer than 20 minutes slows us down. We are alert during the Daily, have our finger on the mute button, and don't read emails or other stuff in parallel!
