We should try to make our working hours as positive as possible. If something is missing, we address it and try to improve it. It doesn't matter initially whether it's about other projects, a different structure of the team meeting, more or less working time, hardware or software, or a HomePod. Not everything is possible, but asking costs nothing. We cannot compensate for deficits that we are not aware of.
