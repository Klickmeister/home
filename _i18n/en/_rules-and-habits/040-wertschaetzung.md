We respect and appreciate others, their work, and their work results, even if others may act differently than we would wish. We do not mock or belittle others, their behavior, or their work; instead, we take them seriously and value them. The same applies to us and our own work. It helps to assume that others are usually doing or have done their best within the specific framework. A small expression of appreciation (technical term: praise) usually makes the world a little better, pleases others, and acts as a lubricant for teams and projects.
