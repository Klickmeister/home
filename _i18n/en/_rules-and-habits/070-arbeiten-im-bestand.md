Our client relationships and, consequently, our projects are highly long-term. Thus, we often work within an existing framework and rarely on a greenfield project. It is helpful to understand and accept this, especially for those who are relatively new to the job. Unlike in academia, we rarely have the opportunity to change the tech stack or easily switch to a different stack in the next project. Much has evolved historically and cannot be changed quickly.

Code, technology, and methodologies change extremely rapidly in our industry. The mentality of "we should completely redo this" is often not very helpful here. The project that might have been based on the hot framework X a few years ago is something no one wants to touch with a ten-foot pole today. However, if we completely refactor it today, the same thing will happen in a few years. This doesn't mean that we don't want to do refactoring; on the contrary, we do it for the client's economic motivation and not solely to improve the developer experience.

It helps to recognize that the team that created the product at time X acted to the best of their knowledge and conscience (see Appreciation) and that the technology used, if it serves its purpose, is meaningful and appropriate. Also, it's helpful to be aware that everything we build today will likely elicit an "oh dear" from us in 10 years because hindsight is always 20/20, and, of course, we'd-know-better-now mentality ðŸ˜‰.
