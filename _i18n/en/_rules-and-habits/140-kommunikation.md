#### Emails
We usually don't need extensive safeguards. This is all the more reason to keep email distribution as small as possible. This way, we also receive fewer emails ourselves. When composing emails, the tone should be friendly, professional (but not formal), relaxed, concise, and understandable. For complex topics, it is very helpful to give a heads-up or engage in a brief phone call with the recipient or key stakeholders, especially when the email is addressed to multiple people. We do not use uppercase letters in the subject! **Never!**

#### Talking Helps
Emails are great. But for many things, they are completely unsuitable. In a phone call or voice chat, many things can be clarified or explained more easily, casually, and much faster.

#### Strategic Informality
We try to avoid a formal "Sie" (you) and informal "Du" (you) distinction within teams. It's not always possible, but often. The goal should be: if one of us addresses the client informally, then everyone does. Using "Du" (informal) reduces distance and promotes a partnership. If we are unsure about communication, we ask the team or the client directly, for example, "I hope it's okay if I use informal language; otherwise, please let me know...".
