We share our knowledge within the team. We aim to have important projects with a driver and a co-driver. For every crucial project, we want to be able to switch the roles of driver and co-driver, and it should be possible for the driver to be on vacation or sick. Responsibility for this lies not with the business or team management but with each driver individually. Please, at regular intervals, everyone should review their projects and topics to ensure there are corresponding co-drivers and that they are capable of acting independently in the project. If not, we empower them to do so.
