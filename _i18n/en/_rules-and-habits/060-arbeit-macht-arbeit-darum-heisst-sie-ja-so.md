At least that's how Stromberg put it. Not everything we do is super cool and incredibly fun. We should try to make it so, or at least, the proportion of things that make us happy/satisfied should be as large as possible. But it will never be everything. We have to accept that. However, if we realize that we no longer feel like being part of Klickmeister, please let us know in time because we can change quite a bit, comparatively. Not everything and often not immediately, but with a little lead time, quite a bit.
