Miriam once coined the beautiful phrase: "I don't work in the emergency room here." And that's true. Of course, we do extremely important things, but usually, no lives are hanging in the balance. In our context, all deadlines are human-made. They don't follow the laws of nature and are therefore changeable. We want to work with joy in the long run. And we need to be mindful of that. It's better to say, "No problem, we can deliver that feature the week after next," than to say, "Okay, I'll try to get it done by Tuesday somehow." Incompatibilities should and can be made explicit: "If it's supposed to be done by Tuesday, X and I would have to work on it on Sunday, is it really that crucial?" or "If it's supposed to be done by Tuesday, we'll have to leave this or that aside for now, does that work?" Saying *No* is a legitimate response. And, generally, we don't need to justify this *No* in detail.

We try to minimize external pressure internallyâ€”a rational consideration of facts often helps with this. And, importantly, we don't pass on the pressure to others. We don't want to be driven, and others don't want that either. We can inform and justify priorities objectively. There's no need to unnecessarily release cortisol.
