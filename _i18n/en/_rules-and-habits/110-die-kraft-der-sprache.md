Language has a surprising influence on thinking and, consequently, on action. We strive to act professionally. Unfortunately, in meetings and other communication situations, interestingly, especially by developers, terms like "basteln" (tinkering), "frickeln" (fiddling), "fummeln" (fumbling), "wimmsen," "kloppen" (banging), "tackern" (tacking), etc., are often used. "I've already tinkered with something there," "We just need to bang the data in there," "I just have to tack the overlays in there," sounds a bit amusing, but it's not very respectful and professional.

We assess the appropriateness of the terms we use. We don't need to unnecessarily complicate our work through complex language and terms, but we should use a value-based, understandable, and professional language in a friendly, binding, and relaxed tone. Please, no bureaucratic language. Thank you!
